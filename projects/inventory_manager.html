            &emsp;A inventory managment tool made in C++ that allows you to view and edit your inventory. 
            This project was made for CS301 Data Structures and Algorithms. The program allows the user to view their inventory, 
            view a specific item and make changes to that item.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The inventory is stored in a json file. To read and write json files in C++ I used this library - 
            <a class="hyperlink" href="https://github.com/nlohmann/json">https://github.com/nlohmann/json</a>. 
            The project was kept relativly simpled and used object oriented design priciples and classes were designed using learned in the class.
