            &emsp;Food ordering application built using Java, JavaFX, and SQL. This project was made while I was at DVC for an Advanced Java class. 
            The project used a SQL database that stored all the data for menu items and current orders. The program used two main pages for ordering. 
            One page allowed the customer to view all menu items, edit their customizations, and add it to their cart. The other page allowed the user 
            to remove menu items and edit the amount of menu items.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Note: The screenshots included are from the first version of the project we turned in. In the first version SQL integeration was not yet 
            required. This is while there is an included screenshot of an example json file that contained menu items.
