            &emsp;A simple client and server based banking system using Java and Java awt. This program was a collaborative effort. 
            More details and the source code can be viewed on github <a class="hyperlink" href="https://github.com/michaelconant/CS401-Banking-System"><u>here</u></a>.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;This project consists of two main clients and one server. One client acts as an ATM and the other client acts as a teller program that can 
            make transactions for the customer. The clients connect to the server to access bank information.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The clients and the server communicate by sending packets of data or requests to each other. These requests are then processed and a result request is sent 
            back with the results of the request.
